- 👋 Hi, I’m @XanaxBarsGSXRs aka Sunny
- 👀 I’m interested in seamlessly connecting all my operations
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning the fundamentals i was in a motorcycle collison. Im noticing the cognitive impairment my physicians assessed. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate peacefully 
- 📫 How to reach me Spokane WA locally or Email maybe we have the same interests.
- I enjoy reading professionally crafted code performances, ive always had the ability to understand any programming code i have ever read and been able to "see" the complete code visually as a map in my head.
- I used to enjoy being able to understand a complete compilation of programming language the 1st time i had set eyes on a language i had no discovered the fundamentals of that programing beforehand.
Kind Regards all
Remind other men and women proudly when witnessing kindness.
